# Feed-Forge

A high-performance, asynchronous Python library designed to unify and simplify data ingestion from multiple sources like RSS feeds and APIs into a single, clean format.

---

## About The Project

Developers often need to pull data from various inconsistent sourcesâ€”RSS feeds, Atom feeds, JSON APIs, and more. Each source has its own data structure and quirks, leading to brittle, custom code for each one.

`Feed-Forge` solves this by providing a single, elegant interface to fetch, parse, and standardize content from any source into a predictable, easy-to-use `FeedItem` object.

### Key Features

* **Unified Schema:** All data is parsed into a standard `FeedItem` object with consistent fields like `.title`, `.url`, and `.published_at`.
* **Asynchronous-First:** Built from the ground up with `asyncio` and `httpx` to handle hundreds of sources concurrently without blocking.
* **Extensible Architecture:** Designed around a `BaseConnector` class, allowing new connectors for different source types to be easily added.
* **Type-Safe & Robust:** Leverages `pydantic` for powerful data validation and parsing, preventing errors from malformed data.

## Installation

Currently, you can install `Feed-Forge` directly from the GitHub repository.

pip install git+[https://github.com/Rudra-K/feed-forge.git](https://github.com/Rudra-K/feed-forge.git)

## Quickstart

Here's how easy it is to fetch articles from multiple RSS feeds at the same time.

```python

import asyncio
from feed_forge import Forge

# A list of RSS feeds to fetch from.
SOURCES = [
    "[https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml](https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml)",
    "[https://www.wired.com/feed/rss](https://www.wired.com/feed/rss)",
    "[https://hnrss.org/frontpage](https://hnrss.org/frontpage)"
]

async def main():
    """Main function to run the fetching process."""
    
    # 1. Create an instance of the main Forge class.
    forge = Forge()
    
    # 2. Fetch all items concurrently.
    print(f"Fetching from {len(SOURCES)} sources")
    all_items = await forge.fetch_all(sources=SOURCES)
    print(f"Found {len(all_items)} total items.")
    
    # 3. Work with the clean, standardized data.
    print("\nLatest from The Verge:")
    for item in all_items:
        if "theverge.com" in str(item.source_url):
            print(f"- {item.title}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

## The `FeedItem` Object

The primary output of `Feed-Forge` is a list of `FeedItem` objects. This object provides a standardized interface to the data, regardless of the original source.

### Key Attributes

* `item.id` (`str`): A unique identifier for the item.
* `item.title` (`str`): The headline or title.
* `item.url` (`HttpUrl`): A validated Pydantic URL object for the original content.
* `item.source_url` (`HttpUrl`): The URL of the feed this item came from.
* `item.summary` (`str | None`): A short summary or description.
* `item.published_at` (`datetime | None`): A timezone-aware datetime object of when the item was published.
* `item.authors` (`List[Author]`): A list of `Author` objects, each with `.name` and `.url` attributes.
* `item.tags` (`List[str]`): A list of tags or categories.
* `item.raw` (`dict | None`): The original, unprocessed data from the source, useful for debugging.

## Future Plans

`Feed-Forge` is actively being developed. Future goals include:

* [ ] Adding a connector for common JSON APIs.
* [ ] Implementing intelligent HTTP caching (ETags, Last-Modified) to be a good internet citizen.
* [ ] Improving source detection logic.
* [ ] Exploring support for more complex sources like newsletters.
